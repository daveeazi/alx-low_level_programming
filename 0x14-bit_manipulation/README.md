# C - Bit manipulation

Project done during the **Full Stack Software Engeering program at ALX**.

# General
* How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators in C Language

# Technologies 
* Scripts written in Bash
* C files are compiled using `gcc`
* C files are written according to the Betty coding standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

# Commands and functions used:
## The bitwise operators:

**XOR OPERATOR - ^,**

**OR OPERATOR - |,**

**AND OPERATOR - &,**

**LEFT SHIFT OPERATOR - <<,**

**RIGHT SHIFT OPERATOR - >>,**

**NOT OPERATOR - ~.**
