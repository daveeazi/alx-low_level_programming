# Even more pointers, arrays and strings

## Learning Objectives

### General

1. What are pointers to pointers and how to use them

2. What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them

3. What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings

Prototype: char *_memset(char *s, char b, unsigned int n); The _memset() function fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the constant byte b Returns a pointer to the memory area s FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: memset. Run man memset to learn more.
